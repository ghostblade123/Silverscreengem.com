<h2>Mainstream Movies Can Get So Dull</h2>
	<p>Movies have always been an art; one that has been commercialized. Sometimes it can be hard for a film<Br> to get off its feet when faced with competition from big IPs and studios, but that's what we're for.  </p>

    <p>On Silverscreengems, we love movies and hate when true gems fall to the wayside. That's why we're committed<Br> to gathering all the movies you may have missed so you'll never overlook what could be your next favorite movie.</p>
   <h3>We'll Show You All Types Of Movies</h3>
   <dl>
      <dt>Upcoming and Underepresented</dt>
      <dd>Amid all the big budget trailers for the blockbusters you've come to expect are the smaller<Br> bits of creativity that don't have the budget to reach out.</dd>

      <dt>Out and Overlooked</dt>
<dd>Looking for something to watch in theaters right now? You'll be able to find great options<Br> that won't fail to entertain today.</dd>

      <dt>Titans Return</dt>

<dd>While not neccessarily underrated, many famous movies of the past are often rereleased<Br> in theaters to celebrate holidays and anniversaries. You'll especially find classic<Br> Halloween and Christmas movies in October and December.</dd>
